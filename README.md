**VMAware** (not to be confused with **VMware**) is an open-source, cross-platform, and incredibly simple C++ library for virtual machine (VM) detection.


It utilises a comprehensive list of low-level and high-level anti-VM techniques that gets accounted in a scoring system. The library is meant to be stupidly easy to use, with the intent to be used by anticheat developers, security researchers, VM enthusiasts, and pretty much anybody who needs a practical and rock-solid VM detection mechanism.


The library is:
- Very easy to use, with only 3 functions in its public interface
- Very flexible with fine-grained control
- Cross-platform (to an extent)
- Header-only
- Available with C++11 and above
- Able to detect VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU, KVM, Parallels, and much more!
- Able to detect semi-VM technologies like hypervisors, docker, and wine
- Able to determine the VM brand
- Incredibly fast (takes around 1~5 milliseconds)
- Memoized, meaning past results are cached and retrieved if ran again for performance benefits

# Example üß™
```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    if (VM::detect()) {
        std::cout << "Virtual machine detected!\n";
        std::cout << "VM name: " << VM::brand() << "\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Running on baremetal\n";
    }
}
```

# CLI tool üîß
This project also provides a tiny, but handy CLI tool utilising the full potential of what the library can do.

# Installation üì•
To install the library, simply download or copy and paste the [vmaware.hpp](src/vmaware.hpp) file to your project. No CMake or build frameworks are necessary, it's literally that simple.

However, if you want the full project (globally accessible headers and the CLI tool), follow these commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware 
cd VMAware/src/
sudo make install
```
NOTE: I'm most likely going to change my username in the future. If the github link doesn't exist, search for the VMAware project and you should find it.
