**VMAware** (not to be confused with VMware) is an open-source, cross-platform, and incredibly simple C++ library for virtual machine detection.

It utilises a comprehensive list of low-level and high-level anti-VM techniques that gets accounted in a scoring system. The library is meant to be stupidly easy to use, with additional features such as brand detection.

The library is:
- Very easy to use, with only 3 functions in its public interface
- Very flexible with fine-grained control
- Cross-platform (NOTE: MSVC IS NOT EFFECTIVE FOR NOW)
- Header-only
- Available with C++11 and above
- Able to detect VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU, KVM, Parallels, and much more
- Able to detect semi-VM technologies like hypervisors, docker, and wine
- Able to determine the VM brand
- Memoized, meaning past results are cached and retrieved if ran again for performance benefits

**IMPORTANT:** The library is currently a beta, so more improvements and cross-compatibility fixes are planned (especially for Windows which I'm currently working on fixing). I don't recommend using this for any serious projects for now.

## Example üß™
```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    if (VM::detect()) {
        std::cout << "Virtual machine detected!" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "VM name: " << VM::brand() << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Running in baremetal" << std::endl;
    }
}
```


## CLI tool üîß
This project also provides a tiny, but handy CLI tool utilising the full potential of what the library can do. Also, running the CLI as root would give better results.

## Installation üì•
To install the library, simply download or copy and paste the [vmaware.hpp](src/vmaware.hpp) file to your project. No CMake or build frameworks are necessary, it's literally that simple.

However, if you want the full project (globally accessible headers with <vmaware.hpp> and the CLI tool), follow these commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware 
cd VMAware
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
```
> NOTE: I'm most likely going to change my username in the future. If the github link doesn't exist, search for the VMAware project and you should find it.


## Documentation üìí
You can view the full docs [here](docs/documentation.md). Trust me, it's not too intimidating.


## Q&A ‚ùì
- Who is this library for?
> It's designed for security researchers, VM engineers, and pretty much anybody who needs a practical and rock-solid VM detection mechanism in their project. For example, if you're making a VM and you're testing the effectiveness of concealing itself, or if you're a malware analyst and you want to check if your VM environment is good enough.

- Why another VM detection project?
> There's already loads of projects that have the same goal such as [InviZzzible](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/InviZzzible), [pafish](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish) and [Al-Khaser](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser). But the difference between the aforementioned projects is that they don't provide a programmable interface to interact with the detection mechanisms, on top of having little to no support for non-Windows systems. I wanted the core detection techniques to be accessible programmatically for everybody to get something useful out of it rather than providing just a CLI tool like the projects above.

- Is it possible to spoof the result?
> Yes. There are some techniques that are trivially spoofable, and there's nothing the library can do about it whether it's a deliberate false negative or even a false positive. This is a problem that every VM detection project is facing, which is why the library is trying to test every technique possible to get the best result based on the environment it's running under. 

- Can I use this for malware?
> This project is not soliciting the development of malware for any malicious intentions. Even if you intend to use it that way, it'll most likely be flagged by antiviruses anyway.

- When will a 1.0 be available?
> Pretty soon, maybe around November (I just started university very recently, so I can't guarantee anything)
